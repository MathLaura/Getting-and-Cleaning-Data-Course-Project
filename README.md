The script run_analysis.R assumes you are in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder. 
The function run() enacts the various subfunctions to make the data set tidy: 
* The first function, read_and_merge(), merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* The second function, activity_names(), uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* The third function, add_descriptive_names(), appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* The fourth function, select_mean_sd_only(), extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* The last function, means_by_activity(), creates a new data frame with the mean of each column subsetted by activity type. It creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The script returns a tidy data set that reports the mean for each of the following taken over each activity type (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING). This is the list of means that are reported:

Acceloration data is reported in standard gravity units, separated into X, Y and Z components. Similarly, velocity is reported in radians/seconds, separated into X, Y and Z components. More about the collection and meaning of each of these is in the files features.txt and features_info.txt, and is quoted below: 

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). "
